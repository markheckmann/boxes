# TODO

* update fields of an item
* keep and retrieve files properly
* rename package to boxed?
* rename depot to box & use word item for elements in a box? Do we need another top layer (depot, store)?
  * item -> pack -> box
  * box -> pick > item
* prune function to delet old boxes/items?
* support remote boxes?
* store enviroment? Maybe we need special method for certain item types.
* default to last used depot by default?
